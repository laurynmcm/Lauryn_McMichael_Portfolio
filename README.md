This website includes a title, working nav bar, about me, interactive link images and a contact me.

The nav bar is designed to be functional. When a link is clicked it will take to to each designated part of the site.
The my work area contains interactive images that grow larger as you hover over them. When you click them they will take you to my work however one is a placeholder.
The contact me contains specific links for each type of information ex. phone number, email and url. Each one is working and updated to my information.
